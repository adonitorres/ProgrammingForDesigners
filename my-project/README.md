# My Project: Social Network for Tabletop Gamers
 Repo for my project (Social Network for Tabletop Gamers)

## Target Audience:  
The target audience for a given tabletop game depends primarily on the genre of the game in question, how it’s played, and how many people are familiar with it. In general, the majority of tabletop games appeal to creative types and storytellers.

Using Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) as the example tabletop game, the target audience in 2020 (https://gamingshogun.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/dd-2020.jpg) was primarily men as they account for 60% of D&D players while women account for 40%. Although there is a relatively even spread between age groups, 60% of D&D players are between the ages of 20 - 34.  These numbers show a rise in the number of women who play D&D as they accounted for 19% of D&D players in 2019.
